# RSICryptoCom
had to formulate a RSI trading strategy for crypto.com/exchange!
right now its symbol pair for trading is just CRO_USD although more coin pairs from the crypto.com/exchange can be implemented into the trading software
Use if you want to edit it debug it turn it in to your root to your next trading bot!
Im developing the bot still and its not totally complete however i just tested it and the websocket stays on a connected loop it may take a very long time running the main.py file within a folder with the other files to execute a trade
The RSI trading strategy may take a very long time to execute a buy or sell depending on market conditions with overbought and oversold market signals building up
The RSICryptoCom git clone is free to use however if you have luck with this software i am developing or turn it into your own project can you donate me a bit of digibyte to support my cause!

thanks for anything
I couldnt really find anything online for a crypto.com/exchange trading software to implement a trading strategy to so i made my own for people to fing and use at their own risk!
remember trading bitcoin and crypto can be risky and never invest all your money into a trading software or a exchange!
I hope you enjoy!
